# Project Name

SQL-TO-DO-LIST

## Description

A simple To-Do List:

This project creates a to-do list for a person to read, write and update tasks when working on a project or for recreational use.

## Installation

1. Create a database named weekend-to-do-app
2. The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate data to allow the application to run. The project is built using Postgres, make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries. Checkout the database.sql file for basic setup.
3. Open the editor of choice and run an npm install
4. Run npm start
